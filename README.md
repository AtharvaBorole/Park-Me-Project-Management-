# Park-Me-Project-Management

🚗 Park Me – “Your Spot, Reserved for the Big Day”
Capstone Project | CIS 5900-01: Information Systems
California State University, Los Angeles | Instructor: Prof. Ngalande

Overview:
In our final capstone project, my team and I designed and developed Park Me, a smart mobile application created to solve one of Los Angeles’ most frustrating daily challenges: finding parking. With the tagline “Your Spot, Reserved for the Big Day,” the app empowers users to locate, reserve, and pay for parking spots in real-time—whether attending a concert, commuting to work, or just running errands.

🔑 Core Features:
Live Spot Finder: Instantly see available parking near your destination with live updates.

Advance Reservations & Secure Payments: Book your spot ahead of time and pay with ease.

Turn-by-Turn Navigation + Car Locator: Navigate directly to your spot and easily find your car later.

Peer-to-Peer Marketplace: Homeowners and businesses can list unused spaces—adding more spots and creating income.

🎨 Design-Driven Approach:
We developed a fully interactive Figma prototype that highlights an intuitive, user-first design. Every screen was designed for simplicity, speed, and accessibility, tested through iterative feedback and user journeys.

🛠️ Tech & Tools Used:
Figma (UI/UX Design)

HTML/CSS (Static website showcasing features)

Risk Assessment Matrix

Agile & Scrum (Task planning & sprints with JIRA)

📊 Project Management in Action:
This project wasn’t just about tech—it was a complete simulation of a real-world product launch. We applied full project management principles including:

Creating a Project Charter to define scope and objectives

Building a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

Identifying and addressing risks with a Risk Matrix

Managing team roles, timelines, and stakeholder communication

🔐 Focused On:
Cybersecurity: Ensured secure transactions and user data protection

Scalability: Explored integration with city smart systems and parking meters

User Experience: Prioritized simplicity, speed, and trust

🌟 Outcome:
Park Me stands as a strong example of how cross-functional collaboration, thoughtful design, and strategic planning can bring a real-world solution to life. It showcases my ability to combine technical expertise, project leadership, and user-centric design—exactly what’s needed in today's fast-paced tech world.
